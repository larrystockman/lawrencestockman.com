Don't you like writting themes, maintaing a CMS and also making sure you database is working? How about those constant patches you have to do to ensure that security is up to par? I hate all of those things! I just wanted to write tech based articles without having to worry about the security of my user name, various passwords, the database or the endless patches for exploits that were discovered in a number of open source CMS systems.


I have used Wordpress, Joomla and a number of other popular packages but it always seemed there was something getting in the way when it came to writing. There was something there just blocking me from writting when I felt inspired. More often than not, I was searching for the next add-on or plugin to enhance the experiance but that just seemed to start bogging down the load times of the pages. This is when I decided to start thinking of a new project to take on and ditch the clunky CMS platforms for something that would allow me to write the way I wanted and also have faster performacne for the user experience.

This is when I stumbled upon **[Hugo](https:/gohugo.io)** which is a static site generator. It allows me to create a template and then feed my data into it to create static pages of my content. The content is rather simple as it's written in Markdown and the templates are in HTML wtih some Javascript as required. I can even extend this further by adding in some react if required for the various modules.

All in all, this project is starting to go well and I will add some serverless functions for some of the required tools so that I have a seamless presentation of information.
